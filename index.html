      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Hello! I'm Xin Hao, a master student majoring in Computer Engineering. 
      I just graduated this summer from Michigan Technological University.</p>
      
      <p>As a software major student, I like programming very much. When I was young, I 
      thought the engineer 
      who can develop games were awesome. This keeps me very interested in programming. 
      What's more, I'm very good at math. As a result, I like solving algorithm problems 
      very much. The more difficult the challenge is, the more excited I will be. 
      I like the coding jobs from my heart. For the languages, I like python, 
      JavaScript and C++. I also have much experience of Matlab and cuda.</p>
      
      <p>Personally, I believe I'm an agile person and I learn new technologies very fast. 
      I'm very confident of this. I can adapt myself to new environment and new tasks 
      quickly. What's more, I think I'm a hard-working guy. Once I get task, I like 
      finishing it at the earliest time instead of the day before deadline. Additionally, 
      I'm careful with all my works. I like to make things as best as I can.</p>
      
      <p>Probably, many new-grads student would mention those characters. But I do believe 
      that I will perform better than most on these characters. I was always one of the best 
      student in school. Additionally, I got prizes in Chinese national competitions of math 
      and physics. That was hard and it should be a good proof of my characters. :-)</p>
      
      <p>You might be thinking, "can't you talk something beyond those tough things?" Well, in 
      life, I like travelling and hiking very much. I have been to many states in East, North, Middle, West
      America, and I have to say there are a lot of beautiful places. Miami would be my next 
      ideal choice. Also, I like playing games with friends, such as League of Lengend.
      If you have any interest to know more about me, please contact me! I'm always liking 
      making new friends.
